Welcome to the new modern fast web site which is authored by Jeff Ye.

The main purpose is to provide a POC of how modern web site should be. Based on one more year of investigation on the main-stream technologies, I finally choose the NodeJS and its popular framework called `express` to build up the web site.

Some more technologies are also adopted within this project in order to prototype in a very short time.

I'd like to list the very cool technologies as below.

## NodeJS express
It's very easy-to-use and powerful dynamic web server framework. Please visit its official [website](http://www.expressjs.com).

## ThreeJS
It's javascript written 3D modeling & rendering engine, running at browser side.

Please visit its official [website](http://www.threejs.org) for more details.

## ShareJS
It's a high efficient collaborating engine, include both server component and client component. It's useful to enable team working together. In my POC, I use it to collaborate 3D modeling.

Please visit its official [website](https://github.com/share) for more details. 

## Bootstrap
It's published by `twitter`, targeted to write beautiful UI on browser.

Please visit its official [website](http://getbootstrap.com/) for more details.

## Others
* nginx

The nginx is usually used as static web server and anti-proxy server. I also used here as the `load balancer`.

* requirejs

It could help you to organize the javascript code base at client side.

* signal
It provides signal dispatching and listening mechanism at client side. It helps you to build up complicated Javascript application.

* markdown

The cool tool used to convert `markdown` text or file to `HTML` file and display on the browser.

* ASM

It is the powerful `BREP` 3D modeling technology. It's running at server side to provide basic 3D modeling functionalities.
